All the game runs through clumsy-min.js. I compile it from the master
that I have. I didn’t include it because of grunt and node_modules,
etc.

The assets are in the data folder.

game.html is where the game is launched from. the canvas is launched
from <div id=“#screen></div>, so if that can be embedded in the
component, I’d guess that would allow it to be run as a separate
entity. I know how how to get the score from the game, and how to put
the top score from he api in, I just couldn’t do that without it being
implemented.

I can change the game and link it all up once the component and routing
is done. (i’m pretty sure…)
